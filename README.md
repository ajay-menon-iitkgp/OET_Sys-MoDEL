## Ocean Engineering Toolbox (OET) - Modelica Library
The Ocean Engineering Toolbox (OET) is a Modelica library to simulate a single-body, floating Wave Energy Converter (WEC) in uni-directional, mono- and polychromatic waves.

This is a work in progress. Current pre-release version: OET v0.2 (2024).

#### Overview

Modelica is a symbolic programming language used to represent Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) in the time-domain. Although it has widespread applications in the automobile and aerospace industries, there is no dedicated Modelica Standard Library (MSL) for the ocean engineering community. A significant reason is the challenge with representing frequency-dependent variables, since Modelica operates solely in the time-domain. Furthermore, the solution to convolution intergals is a significant challenge since a time history of variables cannot be accessed.

Literature demonstrates the critical nature of fequency-dependent models, and the Cummins equation is selected for the OET as an appropriate formulation. The radiation and excitation forces are represented by convolution integrals and have been succesfully implemented in v0.1 and v0.2 respectively. All results are validated against the WEC-Sim time-domain solver developed in SimScape (read about WEC-Sim [here](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim)).
